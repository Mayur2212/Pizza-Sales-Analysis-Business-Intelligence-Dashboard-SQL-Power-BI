SQL and Power BI project transforming raw pizza sales data into interactive dashboards and business-ready insights.

# Pizza Sales Analysis & Business Intelligence Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project presents a complete **data analytics and business intelligence workflow** built using **SQL Server and Power BI**. The objective was to analyze pizza sales data, answer critical business questions, and deliver a **report-ready, interactive dashboard** that supports strategic decision-making for a pizza sales company.

The project demonstrates strong capabilities across **data extraction, transformation, analysis, and visualization**, using real-world datasets and industry-relevant metrics.

---

## Dataset Description
The project uses raw pizza sales transaction data containing:
- Order and order date details
- Pizza categories and sizes
- Quantity sold
- Pricing and revenue information

The dataset was provided in CSV/Excel format and loaded into **SQL Server** for structured analysis and transformation.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Advanced SQL Queries** – Business logic and aggregations
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX, and dashboard creation
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Measures and KPIs
- **Power BI Service-ready Reporting**

---

## Data Preparation & SQL Analysis
A structured SQL-first approach was used before visualization.

### Key SQL Steps Performed
- Imported raw data into SQL Server for structured querying
- Performed data validation and consistency checks
- Created calculated fields for revenue, order metrics, and quantities
- Used aggregate queries to answer business-critical questions such as:
  - Total revenue and total orders
  - Average order value (AOV)
  - Total pizzas sold
  - Average pizzas per order
  - Sales distribution by category, size, day, and month
- Optimized queries to ensure clean, analysis-ready outputs for Power BI

This ensured that Power BI consumed **clean, reliable, and business-ready data** directly from SQL Server.

## Power BI Data Modeling & DAX
After SQL processing, the data was loaded into Power BI for modeling and visualization.

### Key Measures Created Using DAX
- Total Revenue
- Total Orders
- Total Pizzas Sold
- Average Order Value
- Average Pizzas per Order
- Category-wise and size-wise performance metrics

DAX measures were designed to support **dynamic filtering, time-based analysis, and interactive reporting**.

---

## Dashboard & Business Insights
An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to provide actionable insights:

### Key Insights Delivered
- **Busiest Days:** Orders peak on Friday and Saturday evenings
- **Monthly Trends:** Clear seasonality in order volume across months
- **Category Performance:** Classic pizzas contribute the highest sales volume
- **Size Analysis:** Large pizzas dominate total quantity sold
- **Revenue Distribution:** Balanced contribution across pizza categories

The dashboard includes slicers for date range and pizza category, enabling flexible exploration by stakeholders.

---

## Outcome
- Delivered a **fully report-ready and dashboard-ready BI solution**
- Translated raw transactional data into **clear business insights**
- Demonstrated strong integration of **SQL + Power BI + DAX**
- Created a scalable reporting foundation for future business analysis
